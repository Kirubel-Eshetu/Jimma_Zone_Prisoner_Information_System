                Visitation with people committed to the Ethiopia Department of Public Safety & Corrections (DPS&C) is
                a privilege. Visitation may be restricted, denied or suspended if an imprisoned person and/or
                visitor does not follow the Department's visitation rules.
                <br>Prospective visitors may refer to Department Regulation OP-C-9 for specific rules governing
                visitation. The regulation may also be obtained by requesting a copy from the facility. Items
                considered to be contraband, including any type of weapon, firearm or any other item detrimental to
                the security of the facility, are not allowed. Prohibited items and other personal possessions
                (wallet, purse, cash, etc.) must be left in the visitor's locker bulit for visitor's stuffs for the
                duration of the visit.
                <br>The following are the rules that a visitor must follow in order to be allowed to visit an
                inmate in our facility:
            <ol style="font-size: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Visiting List:</strong> In order to visit a person in prison, the visitor must be on
                    the person's approved visiting list. The imprisoned person has been given information on how
                    to add someone to their visiting list. If you are uncertain as to whether you are on a person
                    in prison's approved visiting list, please contact the person you wish to visit. Do not call
                    the facility for this information; it will not be provided over the phone.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Searches:</strong> All visitors, including minors, are subject to searches of their
                    property,
                    automobile and person. These searches shall be conducted by trained staff in a professional
                    manner that minimizes indignity to the visitor while still accomplishing the objective of the
                    search. Additionally, visitors shall be subject to additional searches using metal detectors
                    and ion scanning equipment. Any person refusing to be searched at any time shall not be
                    permitted to enter the facility and a visit may be terminated if a visitor refuses to be
                    searched, or if contraband or other prohibited property or items are found on the visitor
                    or in the visitor's property. If a visitor does not wish to be searched either by hand or
                    by using other means, the visitor should not attempt to enter a DPS&C facility.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Visitors must be registered by staff prior to entering the
                    visiting area.</li><br>

                    to show an identification card(id) the first time they visit the facility. After the first
                    time of visit our system will store the picture of the visitor's identification card(id).
                    <br>The forms of identification accepted by the DPS&C are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Valid driver's license from the state of residence</li>

                    radios, tape recorders, etc.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Only prescribed medication that is life-saving or life-sustaining,
                    such as nitroglycerine pills, inhalers, oxygen, etc., shall be permitted. Medication shall be
                    limited in quantity to no more than that required for the duration of the visit. Visitors must
                    inform the staff at the visiting desk that they are in possession of such medication.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Infants:</strong> If the visitor has an infant child, the following items shall be

                    be stored in a single clear plastic container (i.e., gallon size zip-lock bag.) All items are
                    subject to search.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Money:</strong> Visitors shall not give any money to an imprisoned person. All
                    state correctional facilities utilize Telebirr for money deposits to people in prison.
                    Telebirr allows family members and friends to make a deposit to a person in prison's account
                    in a number of ways via Ethio-telecom shops, mail, internet, telephone, kiosks at the correctional
                    facility,
                    and Moneygram locations.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Contact between people in prison and visitors:</strong> People in prison who have
                    contact visits may embrace (hug) and exchange a brief kiss, to indicate fondness, not a
                    lingering kiss, with their visitor at beginning and end of the visit. During the visit,
                    the only contact permitted is holding hands. Excessive displays of affection or
                    sexual misconduct between people in prison and visitors is strictly prohibited. Small
                    children may be permitted to sit on the lap of the visitor or person in prison.
                    Any improper contact between a person in prison and visitor shall be grounds for stopping
                    the visit immediately. Some people in prison are restricted to non-contact visits. In
                    these cases, there shall be no physical contact or touching at all between the person in
                    prison and the visitors. Restroom breaks may be authorized, however, visitors will
                    be subject to the entire search process again.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Restrictions on visits with minors:</strong> People in prison who have a current or
                    prior conviction for a sex crime involving a minor child family member, or who have a
                    documented history of sex abuse with a minor child family member, are ineligible to visit
                    with any minor child, including their own biological or step-child. People in prison who have
                    a current or prior conviction for a sex crime involving a minor child who is not a family
                    member are ineligible to visit with any minor child. The imprisoned people affected by these
                    restrictions have been informed of possible exceptions that may only be approved by the
                    warden.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Generally prohibited:</strong> The giving or receiving of any item(s) to/from a person
                    in prison without the prior approval of staff is prohibited. Violators are subject to arrest
                    and criminal prosecution and suspension of visiting privileges. The only exception is that the
                    visitor may purchase soft drinks, snacks or concessions in the visiting area and share them
                    with the person in prison. The person in prison is not permitted to take anything out of the
                    visiting area when the visit is finished, other than with approval as noted above.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Visiting hours:</strong> The visiting hours are from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm. The duration
                    of time allowed for a visitor is 2 hours.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Public transportation:</strong> Some DPS&C facilities have public transportation
                    available to the facility. Information is provided at the facility to the people in prison if
                    public transportation is available. There may be a cost for use of this transportation and
                    the DPS&C does not endorse or claim any liability for the use of the transportation provider.
                    The visitor may contact the person they wish to visit in prison to obtain specific
                    information regarding any types of transportation that may be available to the facility
                    where the person is housed. </li><br>
                <li><strong>Directions:</strong> Driving directions may be found on our page or in Google maps.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Other specific information provided by the person in prison or facility:</strong>
                    Contact the imprisoned person you are visiting or the facility for other permissible items,
                    special visit procedures, and availability of picnic visits.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Termination of visits:</strong> The warden of the facility or staff designated by the
                    warden may terminate a visit at any time if they believe that ending the visit is in the best
                    interest
                    of the safety and security of the facility or the persons involved.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Request for ADA accommodations:</strong> For ADA accommodations, please contact the
                    facility in advance of your visit.</li>

            <h2 id="communicate" style="text-align:center;">Communicate With People in Prison</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Department encourages positive communication between people in prison and
                family
                members/friends. As such, DPS&C offers several avenues of communication for people assigned to
                state correctional facilities. People in prison may communicate via secure telephones.
                Family members may also send money to people in DPS&C custody.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;" id="telephone">Telephone Communication</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;">Dept. Regulation No. B-08-001 allows for each imprisoned
                person to have an
                approved master list of up to twenty (20) telephone numbers for family, friends, and legal calls.
                An imprisoned person can update the list on a quarterly basis. If a person in prison attempts to dial
                any telephone number not on his/her approved list from a state correctional facility, the call is
                automatically blocked. Individual telephone numbers can be blocked as well. <br>Members of the public
                can
                contact the facility directly or the Office of Adult Services (<a href="tel: +251900000994">
                    +251900000994</a>) if they are receiving unwanted or harassing phone calls from imprisoned people at
                state correctional facilities.People in prison can only make collect calls and prison telephones are
                limited to out-going calls only. Calls are usually limited to 15 minutes. No one can make a call
                to a prison telephone. <br> When a person in prison makes a call, the called party is notified that it
                is a collect call from a person at a state prison facility. The called party is given the option of
                accepting the call or refusing it by hanging up. Telephone communication access is provided by Ethio
                Telecom. Securus' Customer Service number is <a href="tel: +251900000994">+251900000994</a> for
                individuals needing assistance with billing issues, problems receiving calls from people in prison,
                receiving unwanted calls and/or requesting a block on future calls from an individual(s) in prison.
                <br>The Department allows people in prison to call approved cell phone numbers under specific
                guidelines.
                The called party must set up an account with Securus and provide their primary residence information.
                Calls to prepaid cell phones are not allowed. The imprisoned individual must have your cell phone
                number on his/her approved phone list.
            </p>
            <h3 id="send" style="text-align: center;">Send Money to People in Prison</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Family and friends can send funds to people in prison through banks advance
                Telebirr. When sending money the many should be credited to the account number of the facility with
                the prisoner name on it. That way the facility can address the money send to the inmate properly.
            </p>
            <h3 id="mail" style="text-align: center;">Mail</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Family and friends may continue to send money orders via mail. There is
                no charge for sending money orders via mail. Telebirr requires a Telebirr deposit slip to accompany
                the money order. This deposit is mailed to Telebirr Jimma, Jimma address. This means that mail time to
                Jimma is probably longer than to a DPS&C facility and that should be taken into account when mailing
                funds.</p>
