➢ Storing Prisoner information securely through a database system.

➢ Storing visitor information efficiently.

➢ Parole point evaluation for individual inmate.

➢ Report and certificate preparation.

➢ Integrated face-detection and matching system.

Since the system was developed for a final year project defense, a detailed documentation was also made. The documentation of the project was presented in two phases: 

-> System Design and Implementaiton. 

- The documentation is the manual that can help you to understand and use the system. Since the system is open source, you can see the system's blueprint through this documentation. 

-- The documentation contains the following chapters:

-> Introduction to the proposal of the system

-> Requirement Analysis and Specification

-> System Design

-> Implementation and Testing 

-> Conclusions and Recommendations
