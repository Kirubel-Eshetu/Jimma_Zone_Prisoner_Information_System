# Jimma_Zone_Prisoner_Information_System
This system was developed for Final Year Project defense in Jimma University on 2024 .

The developed system is called Jimma Zone Prisoner Information system (JZPIS). The system 
is implemented through a website. The website serves a range of functionalities including:

➢ Providing information about Jimma Zone Prison Administration.

➢ Serves rules and guidelines for visitors.

➢ Gives ways people can contact prison personnel.

➢ Presenting the contents in three languages. Amharic, English and Oromo.

➢ Adding extra layer of security for logging into user accounts with OTP.

➢ Managing user accounts.

➢ Creating backups.

➢ Visualizing comments and suggestions given.

➢ Storing Prisoner information securely through a database system.

➢ Storing visitor information efficiently.

➢ Parole point evaluation for individual inmate.

➢ Report and certificate preparation.

➢ Integrated face-detection and matching system.

➢ Management of prison cell.

Since the system was developed for a final year project defense, a detailed documentation was also made. The documentation of the project was presented in two phases: 

-> System Design and
-> Implementaiton. 

--The documentation is the manual that can help you to understand and use the system. Since the system is open source, you can see the system's blueprint through this documentation. 

--The documentation contains the following chapters:

-> Introduction to the proposal of the system

-> Requirement Analysis and Specification

-> System Design

-> Implementation and Testing 

-> Conclusions and Recommendations
