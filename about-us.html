        <p class="detail">The administration of Jimma Zone Prison was founded in 1937. It has been a major part of
            Ethiopia's
            history and is among the nation's oldest prisons. Situated in Jimma around Kochi, the facility is
            in charge of overseeing and managing inmates who have been found guilty of a range of offenses.
            <br>
            The prison contains three structures inside of it. The first one is where male prisoners are kept.
            The second is for female prisoners and the third one is for male children who are between the
            ages 9 to 18.
            Females inmates who are at the age between 9 to 18 are kept in prison with adult
            female prisoners. <br>
            The administration of the prison is essential to guaranteeing the security and rehabilitation of the
            prisoners. In addition to preserving law and order inside the prison, it seeks to support inmates'
            rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
            Like any other prison administration, Jimma Prison complies with the laws and rules established
            by the Ethiopian government. It collaborates closely with the legal system to uphold judgments
            and give convicts suitable. <br>
            The prison administration also makes an effort to offer basic facilities, medical care, and
            educational opportunities to prisoners so they can learn new skills and information while they are
            confined. Reducing recidivism rates and preparing inmates for a smooth transition back into
            society after release are the two main objectives of this prison.
